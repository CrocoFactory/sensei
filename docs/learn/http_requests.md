## What are HTTP Requests?

When building or interacting with web APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), it's essential to understand how 
communication between clients (like your browser or an application) and servers occurs. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) 
is the foundation of this communication. **HTTP methods** (or verbs) are a key part of how clients request actions from 
the server and how the server responds.

In this article, we'll cover the most common HTTP methods, their purposes, and how they form the basis for interacting 
with APIs.

## What is HTTP?

**HTTP** is a protocol that defines how messages are formatted and transmitted between a client (such as a web browser) 
and a server. It also determines how servers respond to various requests.

When you interact with an API, you use HTTP to make requests. Each request is an action you want the server to perform. 
The server then sends a response back, usually in the form of data, a status code, and/or a message.

## HTTP Methods

An **idempotent** method is an operation that can be performed multiple times without changing the result beyond the 
initial application. In the context of HTTP methods, idempotency ensures that making the same request multiple times will yield the same outcome as making it once. This property is especially important in web APIs, as it helps maintain consistency and predictability in interactions.

There are several HTTP methods, each with a specific role. Let’s explore the most commonly used ones:

### 1. GET
- **Purpose**: Retrieve data from a server.
- **Use Case**: When you want to fetch information without modifying anything.
- **Example**: 
    - Retrieving a list of products from an online store.
    - Accessing a user’s profile information.
  
- **How it works**: GET is idempotent. When you send a GET request, you're asking the server to send back the requested resource. 
   It’s a read-only operation, meaning it doesn’t change any server data.

```http
GET /users/123
```

In this example, the client is requesting information about a user with ID `123`.

### 2. POST
- **Purpose**: Send data to the server to create a new resource.
- **Use Case**: When you’re submitting form data, creating a new user account, or adding an item to a database.
- **Example**: 
    - Posting a new blog article.
    - Submitting a registration form to create a new user.

- **How it works**: The client sends data to the server, typically in the body of the request. The server processes 
   this data and creates a new resource based on it.

```http
POST /users
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

In this example, the client is sending a new user’s data to the server, and the server will create that user in its database.

### 3. PUT
- **Purpose**: Update an existing resource on the server.
- **Use Case**: When you need to update data, like modifying a user's profile or changing the details of an existing item.
- **Example**: 
    - Updating a product’s price.
    - Changing user account information.

- **How it works**: PUT is idempotent. This method usually replaces the entire resource with the new data you send.

```http
PUT /users/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "name": "John Smith",
    "email": "johnsmith@example.com"
}
```

Here, the client is updating the details of the user with ID `123`.

### 4. PATCH
- **Purpose**: Partially update an existing resource on the server.
- **Use Case**: When you need to update only specific fields of a resource, like changing just the email address of a user.
- **Example**: 
    - Changing the stock quantity of an item in a store.
    - Updating a single field of a user's profile without sending all the data.

- **How it works**: Unlike PUT, PATCH only updates the specific fields provided in the request body.

```http
PATCH /users/123
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "email": "newemail@example.com"
}
```

In this example, only the email field of the user with ID `123` is updated.

### 5. DELETE
- **Purpose**: Delete a resource from the server.
- **Use Case**: When you need to remove data, such as deleting a user account or removing a post.
- **Example**: 
    - Deleting a product from an online store.
    - Removing a user’s account from the system.

- **How it works**: DELETE is idempotent. The server deletes the specified resource, and after the operation, the resource is no longer available.

```http
DELETE /users/123
```

This request will remove the user with ID `123` from the server.

## API Endpoints and Routes

An **API endpoint** is a specific path where the client can send requests. The endpoint typically includes a 
**route** (or URL) and is associated with an HTTP method.

- Example: `/users` could be an endpoint for a user-related API.  
- A **route** can often include parameters to identify specific resources, like `/users/123` where `123` is the 
  user’s ID.

When interacting with an API, you’ll combine a method with an endpoint to perform an action. For instance:
- **GET** `/users` – Retrieve a list of users.
- **GET** `/users/123` – Retrieve information about the user with ID `123`.
- **POST** `/users` – Create a new user.
- **DELETE** `/users/123` – Delete the user with ID `123`.

## HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are standardized codes returned by the server in response to an HTTP request. They provide information about the status of the request, and they are grouped into five categories, each representing a different type of response.

#### 1. 1xx Informational

These codes indicate that the request has been received and is still being processed. They are primarily used for communication between the client and server during the request lifecycle.

- **100 Continue**: The server has received the initial part of the request and the client should continue with the rest of the request. This status is often sent in response to a `POST` or `PUT` request where the client must send a large amount of data.
- **101 Switching Protocols**: The server is switching protocols as requested by the client. This is commonly used when a client requests to switch from HTTP to a different protocol, such as WebSocket.

#### 2. 2xx Success

These codes indicate that the request was successful and the server has fulfilled the request.

- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server returned the requested data.
- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a new resource was created (often seen in POST requests).
- **204 No Content**: The request was successful, but there is no content to return (common for DELETE requests).

#### 3. 3xx Redirection

These codes indicate that further action is needed to complete the request.

- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been moved to a new URL permanently.
- **302 Found**: The requested resource resides temporarily at a different URL.
- **304 Not Modified**: The resource has not changed since the last request, allowing the client to use a cached version.

#### 4. 4xx Client Error

These codes indicate that there was an error with the client's request.

- **400 Bad Request**: The server could not understand the request due to invalid syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Authentication is required, and the client has not provided valid credentials.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understood the request, but refuses to authorize it.
- **404 Not Found**: The server cannot find the requested resource.

#### 5. 5xx Server Error

These codes indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request.

- **500 Internal Server Error**: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server received an invalid response from an upstream server while trying to fulfill the request.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unable to handle the request due to temporary overload or maintenance.

## Making HTTP Requests in Python

The `requests` module is a popular library in Python that simplifies making HTTP requests. To get started, you first need to install the module if you haven’t already. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install requests
```

Once you have the `requests` module installed, you can start making various types of HTTP requests, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and more. For example, to perform a simple GET request, you can use the following code snippet:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(data)
else:
    print(f'Error: {response.status_code}')
```

In this example, the `get` function sends a GET request to the specified URL. The response from the server is stored in the `response` variable. You can check the response status code to determine whether the request was successful (HTTP status code 200 indicates success). If the request was successful, you can retrieve the JSON data from the response using the `json()` method.

For making POST requests, the syntax is similar. You can send data to the server as follows:

```python
data = {'key': 'value'}
response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/data', json=data)
```

This sends a POST request to the specified URL with the provided data formatted as JSON. You can similarly use the `put`, `delete` and another methods for updating or deleting resources.

## Types of Request Arguments

When making HTTP requests, various arguments can be passed to customize the request and convey additional information to the server. These arguments typically fall into several categories: query parameters, body parameters, path parameters, headers, and cookies. Understanding each type helps ensure that your requests are structured correctly for effective communication with APIs.

### Query Parameters

Query parameters are appended to the URL of an HTTP request and are used to send additional information to the server. They typically appear after a question mark (`?`) in the URL and are separated by ampersands (`&`). Query parameters are commonly used for filtering, sorting, or paginating data.

For example, a URL with query parameters might look like this:

```
https://api.example.com/data?search=keyword&page=2&limit=10
```

In Python's `requests` module, you can pass query parameters as a dictionary using the `params` argument:

```python
import requests

params = {'search': 'keyword', 'page': 2, 'limit': 10}
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data', params=params)
```

### Body Parameters

Body parameters are used to send data to the server as part of the request body, particularly in POST and PUT requests. This data can be sent in various formats, such as JSON, form data, or XML. Body parameters are not visible in the URL and are used for operations that create or update resources.

When sending JSON data, you can use the `json` argument in `requests`:

```python
import requests

data = {'key': 'value', 'another_key': 'another_value'}
response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/data', json=data)
```

For form data, you can use the `data` argument:

```python
import requests

form_data = {'key': 'value', 'another_key': 'another_value'}
response = requests.post('https://api.example.com/data', data=form_data)
```

### Path Parameters

Path parameters are used to specify specific resources within the URL. They are part of the URL path and are typically enclosed in curly braces `{}` in the API definition. Path parameters allow you to pass information that determines which resource you want to interact with.

For example, in the following URL, `123` is a path parameter representing a specific resource ID:

```
https://api.example.com/data/123
```

In `requests`, you can format the URL string to include path parameters:

```python
import requests

resource_id = 123
response = requests.get(f'https://api.example.com/data/{resource_id}')
```

### Headers

Headers are key-value pairs sent along with the request that provide additional context or metadata about the request. Headers can include information such as content type, authorization tokens, user agents, and more. They are essential for ensuring the server correctly processes the request.

You can pass headers in `requests` using the `headers` argument:

```python
import requests

headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data', headers=headers)
```

### Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data stored on the client side and sent along with HTTP requests. They are often used for session management, tracking user preferences, or maintaining state between requests. When the server sets a cookie, it can be sent back with subsequent requests to maintain the session or other data.

In `requests`, you can manage cookies by passing them in the `cookies` argument:

```python
import requests

cookies = {'session_id': 'your_session_id'}
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data', cookies=cookies)
```
                    
## Better Solution for HTTP Requests: Introducing `httpx`

While the `requests` library is a popular choice for making HTTP requests in Python, `httpx` offers several enhancements and modern features that can improve your API interaction experience. Here’s a closer look at `httpx`, its similarities with `requests`, the concept of the client, client parameters, and the importance of closing the client.

`httpx` is a powerful HTTP client for Python that is designed to be an improvement over `requests`. It not only maintains the simplicity and ease of use found in `requests`, but it also introduces additional features, including support for asynchronous requests, which allows for non-blocking network calls.

To install `httpx`, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install httpx
```

### Similarities to `requests`

One of the most appealing aspects of `httpx` is its API design, which closely resembles that of `requests`. This means that if you're already familiar with `requests`, transitioning to `httpx` will feel natural. Both libraries provide similar methods for making GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests, and so on. 

Here are examples of GET and POST requests in both libraries:

Using `requests`:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
data = response.json()
```

Using `httpx`:

```python
import httpx

response = httpx.get('https://api.example.com/data')
data = response.json()
```

As you can see, the syntax and structure of making requests are almost identical.

### Understanding the Client

The client in `httpx` is an essential component that manages connection settings and facilitates making multiple requests. You can create a client instance using `httpx.Client()` for synchronous requests or `httpx.AsyncClient()` for asynchronous requests. The client is responsible for maintaining a pool of connections, which improves performance when making several requests to the same server.

Using a client provides several benefits:

- **Connection Pooling**: Reuses existing connections for multiple requests to the same host, reducing latency and improving performance.
- **Configuration Management**: Allows you to define common settings like headers, timeouts, and base URLs in one place, making your code cleaner and more maintainable.

When creating an `httpx.Client`, you can customize it with several parameters:

- **`base_url`**: A base URL that serves as a prefix for all requests made using the client. This simplifies the construction of endpoints.

    ```python
    client = httpx.Client(base_url='https://api.example.com')
    ```

- **`timeout`**: Defines how long the client should wait for a response before timing out. You can set both connect and read timeouts.

    ```python
    timeout = httpx.Timeout(connect=5.0, read=10.0)
    client = httpx.Client(timeout=timeout)
    ```

- **`headers`**: Sets default headers for all requests made with the client, which is useful for managing authorization tokens or content types.

    ```python
    headers = {'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TOKEN'}
    client = httpx.Client(headers=headers)
    ```

- **`cookies`**: Allows you to manage cookies that should be sent with requests, maintaining session state or user preferences.

    ```python
    cookies = {'session_id': 'your_session_id'}
    client = httpx.Client(cookies=cookies)
    ```

Using these parameters helps you create a more organized and efficient codebase, as you can define shared settings in one place.

### Why You Need to Close the Client

Closing the `httpx.Client` is crucial for proper resource management. When you create a client instance, it opens a connection pool to the specified server(s). If you don't close the client after use, it can lead to several issues:

- **Resource Leakage**: Open connections may linger indefinitely, consuming system resources and leading to potential memory exhaustion or application slowdowns.
- **Socket Limits**: Operating systems impose limits on the number of open sockets. Not closing clients can result in hitting these limits, causing errors when trying to make new connections.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Closing the client ensures that any pending requests complete correctly and that resources associated with the client are released.

To ensure the client is closed properly, you can use it within a `with` statement, which automatically closes the client when the block is exited:

```python
with httpx.Client() as client:
    response = client.get('https://api.example.com/data')
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        print(data)
```

This practice promotes efficient resource management and helps avoid potential issues related to unclosed connections.

### Conclusion

`httpx` provides a robust and modern alternative to the `requests` library, with enhancements such as asynchronous support and improved client management. Its API design makes it easy for existing `requests` users to adopt, while features like connection pooling and configurable client parameters enhance performance and maintainability. Closing the client properly ensures efficient use of resources, making `httpx` a compelling choice for handling HTTP requests in Python applications.
